# My Contribution to Vesatogo Innovations

I completed a React.js application using the SpaceX GraphQL API to display and query SpaceX data. Key features include infinite scrolling, detailed item views, sorting, and filtering.

## Key Contributions

### Frontend Development
- Built a dynamic and responsive UI using ReactJS.
- Styled with TailwindCSS for a modern look.

### GraphQL Integration
- Used Apollo Client for efficient data fetching from the SpaceX GraphQL API.

### Features
- Implemented infinite scrolling.
- Added routing for detailed views.
- Provided sorting and filtering options.

### Deployment
- Hosted the application on Vercel ensuring easy access, continuous integration, and continuous deployment for your ease of evaluation.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: ReactJS
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Data**: Apollo Client, GraphQL
- **Routing**: react-router-dom
- **Infinite Scrolling**: IntersectionObserver API (Default HTML)
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub: [SkyRocket Repository](https://github.com/sanketshivale/SkyRocket)
- **Extras**: react-icons, react-loading-skeleton, react-spinners

## Installation

To set up the project locally, ensure you have the latest version of Node.js installed. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sanketshivale/SkyRocket.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd SkyRocket
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

This will start the application on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Impact
My work demonstrates the ability to deliver robust, user-friendly applications using modern web technologies. It contributes to Vesatogo Innovations by enhancing frontend capabilities and ensuring scalable, maintainable code.

## Learning
This project provided me with valuable experience in working with GraphQL, Apollo Client, and ReactJS. I gained insights into building dynamic, responsive UIs and learned how to integrate third-party APIs effectively. I also improved my skills in state management, routing, and data fetching, which will be beneficial for future projects. I look forward to applying my knowledge and skills to future projects and contributing to Vesatogo Innovations' success.

## Fall Backs
- Mutation queries are not working, so I was unable to implement them.
- Subscriptions for real-time data are not implemented.
- Some query APIs are not working or provide empty or null values.
- I have not implemented testing for the application.

## Optimization
- More components can be created to make the code more modular and reusable. One such example is that every list view has the same functionality; this can be modularized.
- The application can be optimized further by implementing code splitting and server-side rendering.
- Additionally, performance can be improved by optimizing queries, caching data, and reducing the number of network requests.

I would be happy to discuss these optimizations further and implement them as needed.

Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to Vesatogo Innovations!
